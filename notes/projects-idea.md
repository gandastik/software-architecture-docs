### What problems I've encountered - Train are late -> make people waited for too long -> built a app that can remind the people when the train are close
  - basically a gps for train lmao
- Classroom full
  - a booking site that let you book the seat for the class...
- Classroom full because of the registration sucks
  - build a new registrations site

### Ideas
- Flimatics (Flims + Fanatic) => obsessed with flims
  - movies site, user can put movies in watchlist, rate movies, write a reviews, read a review, add movies to collections,
  - like a social media it's just for a user which means that user can interact to each others, like, follow, block, ... to each others
- LiftAtKmitl (the tools to improve the daily life of the student at KMITL)
  - schedule managment system
  - find available subject to register
  - write/read review(s) about a subject
  - booking system (book the seat, book the book, ..)
